Problem 1:
Requirement:
Write a python program and send back readme file, .py files with proper code design structure, documentation and tests in a .zip file
Readme file: please include everything a reader needs to know about the program
The program should be runnable with python 3.6

Details:
Randomly generate a 5-digit number.
Ask the user to guess this number:
For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “head”
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place, they have a “tail.”
Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “heads” and “tails” they have. Once the user guessed the correct number, the game is over.
Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.
Say the number generated by the computer is 58947. An expected interaction looks like this:
  Welcome to the Game!
  Enter a number:
  >>> 58123
  2 heads, 0 tails
  >>> 57123
  1 head, 1 tail
  ...
Until the user guessed the number.
Pay attention when the numbers have repeated digits.
